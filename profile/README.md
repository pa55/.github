## General information

Conceived around 2014, the purpose of PA55 can be best described as follows.

> pa55 is a new way to solve the problem of remembering difficult-to-guess passwords. The idea is to deterministically generate strong passwords based on some easy-to-remember but difficult-to-guess information.

This later evolved to PA55 NYAPS: https://pa55.github.io/pa55nyaps/

While a desktop version and an iOS version (and an Android version for PA55, not PA55NYAPS) were made available, there was a flurry of commercial password managers in the years that followed. Various factors contributed to the lack of continued development of PA55NYAPS.

As of September 2022, with continued and successful move away from passwords, the need for password managers is questionable. [Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.io/), for example, is now available on more than one platforms and is a collaboration between Apple, Microsoft and Google (at the time of writing this).

Given this trend, from September 2022, the development of PA55 and PA55NYAPS code should be considered frozen; with all relevant repositories archived.
